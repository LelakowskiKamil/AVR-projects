The system reads values from two photoresistors, distinguishing positions: 1 - for the first photoresistor,
2-position intermediate between 1 and 2 photoresistor and 3-for the second photoresistor. 
The read values are displayed on the display, they are the determinant to set the servo in the right position. 
The generated current powers the LED.
